1. Colorado weather can be strange and unpredictable, and sometimes the temperature when you leave the house in the morning is vastly different from the temperature in the afternoon or evening (recently we had a 60&deg; temperature shift in a single day). I always pack a <strong>scarf</strong> just in case.
2. Same as #1, though a <strong>hat** helps with the unpredictable wind as well. I actually knitted this one myself.
3. Currently I commute every day using the Fort Collins bus system, Transfort. Access is pretty good, though I do wish it ran on Sundays, a little later during the evening, and went past my house more often...I got an unlimited <strong>bus pass</strong> last summer and I use it at least 5 days a week.
4. My <strong>New 3DS XL</strong>, currently loaded with Pok√©mon Alpha Sapphire. It's nice to take a break and unwind once in a while, stay entertained while cycling at the gym, and have some leisure during my commute, which makes me much more motivated to be productive once I get home.
5. As someone who's extremely sensitive to light, it seems like a migraine is always around the corner, <strong>headache relief</strong> is a must (especially when staring at a Mac all day long).
6. My bag is notably lacking a laptop...I have an iMac at work and a Mac Mini at home. Having a proper <strong>notebook and pen</strong> are the only reason I haven't lost my mind (though it did take quite some time to find a pen that isn't too skinny).
7. Colorado has a noticeable lack of moisture, and most people carry around <strong>heavy-duty lip balm</strong>.
8. <strong>Wallet</strong>
9. Though I've heard that the "300 days of sunshine" statistic is false, most days call for <strong>sunglasses</strong>.
10. <strong>Pocket knife</strong>
11. <strong>Keys, emergency beer liberator, and gym pass.</strong>
12. I apply <strong>coffee</strong> liberally throughout my day.
